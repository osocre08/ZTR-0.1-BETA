Zone Textures Rework (ZTR)

Zone Textures Rework (ZTR) is a texture overhaul project for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly, aiming to replace outdated textures with brand-new, modern visuals — all while preserving the authentic atmosphere of Call of Pripyat and Anomaly.

This pack delivers higher-quality, up-to-date materials that maintain the classic S.T.A.L.K.E.R. feeling, enhancing immersion and visual consistency across the entire Zone.
